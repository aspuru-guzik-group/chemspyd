For each existing functions the following must be done:
    - ensure that all variables that can be manipulated in autosuite are implemented in the manager
    - ensure that all variables that are implemented in the manager are implemented in the controller
    - ensure that all variables are falling within the acceptable ranges of the chemspeed
        - (check after all functions implemented)

functions to check:
        - (done) transfer_liquid()
            - allow multiple aspirations
            - allow multiple needle dispensation (needle 1 and 2)

        - (done) transfer_liquid_bu()
            - I believe this function can be removed or folded into

        - (done) inject_liquid()

    - transfer_solid()
        - option for autodispense
        - option for advanced parameters
        - parameters sent in as dictionary

    - transfer_solid_swile
    - set_drawer()
    - set_insynth_reflux()
    - set_isynth_temperature()              # try to remove isynth specific functions
    - set_isynth_stir()
        - (done) set_stir()
    - set_isynth_vacuum()
    - set_isynth()
        - (done) vial_transport()
    - set_zone_state()
        - (done) measure_level()
        - (done) unmount_all()
        - (done) stop_manager()
    - read_status()

functions in manager but not controller
    - screwcapping()

functions to implement anew
    - play_sound
